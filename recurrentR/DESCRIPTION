Description: This package provides an implementation of semi-parametric 
      recurrent data analysis which studies how to estimate the recurrence 
      process and survival function without assuming the independence between 
      them. More specifically, this package implements the algorithm proposed 
      in the three following papers: M.-C. Wang, Qin, and Chiang (2001), Huang 
      and Chiung-Yu Huang and Wang (2004), and C.-Y. Huang, Qin, and Wang 
      (2010).
