 abstract = {Recurrent event data are frequently encountered in longitudinal follow-up studies. In statistical literature, noninformative censoring is typically assumed when statistical methods and theory are developed for analyzing recurrent event data. In many applications, however, the observation of recurrent events could be terminated by informative dropouts or failure events, and it is unrealistic to assume that the censoring mechanism is independent of the recurrent event process. In this article we consider recurrent events of the same type and allow the censoring mechanism to be possibly informative. The occurrence of recurrent events is modeled by a subject-specific nonstationary Poisson process via a latent variable. A multiplicative intensity model is used as the underlying model for nonparametric estimation of the cumulative rate function. The multiplicative intensity model is also extended to a regression model by taking the covariate information into account. Statistical methods and theory are developed for estimation of the cumulative rate function and regression parameters. As a major feature of this article, we treat the distributions of both the censoring and latent variables as nuisance parameters. We avoid modeling and estimating the nuisance parameters by proper procedures. An analysis of the AIDS Link to Intravenous Experiences cohort data is presented to illustrate the proposed methods.},

 abstract = {Recurrent event data are commonly encountered in longitudinal follow-up studies related to biomedical science, econometrics, reliability, and demography. In many studies, recurrent events serve as important measurements for evaluating disease progression, health deterioration, or insurance risk. When analyzing recurrent event data, an independent censoring condition is typically required for the construction of statistical methods. In some situations, however, the terminating time for observing recurrent events could be correlated with the recurrent event process, thus violating the assumption of independent censoring. In this article, we consider joint modeling of a recurrent event process and a failure time in which a common subject-specific latent variable is used to model the association between the intensity of the recurrent event process and the hazard of the failure time. The proposed joint model is flexible in that no parametric assumptions on the distributions of censoring times and latent variables are made, and under the model, informative censoring is allowed for observing both the recurrent events and failure times. We propose a "borrow-strength estimation procedure" by first estimating the value of the latent variable from recurrent event data, then using the estimated value in the failure time model. Some interesting implications and trajectories of the proposed model are presented. Properties of the regression parameter estimates and the estimated baseline cumulative hazard functions are also studied.},

 abstract = {Recurrent event data analyses are usually conducted under the assumption that the censoring time is independent of the recurrent event process. In many applications the censoring time can be informative about the underlying recurrent event process, especially in situations where a correlated failure event could potentially terminate the observation of recurrent events. In this article, we consider a semiparametric model of recurrent event data that allows correlations between censoring times and recurrent event process via frailty. This flexible framework incorporates both time-dependent and time-independent covariates in the formulation, while leaving the distributions of frailty and censoring times unspecified. We propose a novel semiparametric inference procedure that depends on neither the frailty nor the censoring time distribution. Large sample properties of the regression parameter estimates and the estimated baseline cumulative intensity functions are studied. Numerical studies demonstrate that the proposed methodology performs well for realistic sample sizes. An analysis of hospitalization data for patients in an AIDS cohort study is presented to illustrate the proposed method.},
